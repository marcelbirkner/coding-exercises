# Run main program

Program will ask for user input for absolute filepath. This file is parsed line-by-line to be able to handle large files.
URLs with the highest count are returned in decending order. By default the result is limited to 10 URLs.

Expected file content:

```
<url value> <whitespace> <long value>
```

Run program:

```
go run fileprocessor.go
```

# Run Tests 

```
/usr/local/bin/go test

# Handle Edge Cases

- [x] validate user input
- [x] wrong filepath
- [x] empty file
- [x] handle different whitespaces

# Create test files

```
rm generatedfile.txt
for i in {1..10000000}
do
 echo "http://api.tech.com/item/${i}   ${i}" >> generatedfile.txt
done
```
